## [Forty Two - code for fun!](https://forty-two.netlify.com/)

Code against your friends!

The goal is to see who can complete their objective first. You each get forty two alterations each turn. But watch out: you'll be working in the same file!
Try to outwit your component by using their own code against them!

By the way, don't delay; after 30 seconds your alterations will start to dwindle by the second ;)
Have fun!

## Open source :)

This is an open source game, and I think it can get better so if you find it fun (or not), please feel free to contribute.
